# Panel-RPG
:world_map: A game of six simultaneous RPGs.

Created for [Ludum Dare 38 "A Small World"](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38), but not submitted because I started a day late and am one person. Inspired by [Squidi's Tiny Crawl World idea](http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=29).

Play the game [here](https://orez-.github.io/Panel-RPG/src/)!

To run the game locally clone the repo and [start any webserver](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started/index). I recommend the python simple HTTP server:

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

The game will be available at http://localhost:8000/src/ in your browser.
